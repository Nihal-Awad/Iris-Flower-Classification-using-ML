# Iris-Flower-Classification-using-ML
The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features. I used Machine learning algorithms like Logistic regression model, KNN(K-Nearest Neighbor) model, Decision Tree model,Support Vector Machine model.
